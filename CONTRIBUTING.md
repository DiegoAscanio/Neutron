# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! Neutron welcomes everyone to contribute, but first please read below.

## Getting Started

Neutron is still in its early stages thus has many [to-dos](https://github.com/IanTerzo/Neutron/blob/main/TODO.md). An easy way to get started is to code a to-do. https://github.com/IanTerzo/Neutron/blob/main/TODO.md


## Pull Requests And Commits 

If a small change is needed feel free to commit, but keep in mind these things:

- Have a good and explanatory name for your commit, e.g. no "Fixed code" or "Added feature".
  
- Always test your code before making a commit.  

If you are planning on implementing a bigger feature please fork and clone the project to you machine where you can develop it, once your done commit the changes to your fork and make a pull request.'
