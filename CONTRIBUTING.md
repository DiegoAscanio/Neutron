Thanks for contributing! Neutron welcomes everyone to contribute, but first please read below.

## Getting Started

Neutron is still in its Alpha phase and thus has many [to-dos](https://github.com/IanTerzo/Neutron/blob/main/TODO.md). The to-dos range from adding new HTML elements to recreating the DOM methods,  an easy way to get started coding is to see the description of a to-do. The description offers multiple details to the problem or task and where in the code it belongs. https://github.com/IanTerzo/Neutron/blob/main/TODO.md


## Pull Requests And Commits 

- Commits do not need to be small. 

- Have a good and explanatory name for your commit, e.g. no "Fixed code" or "Added feature".
  
- Always test your new feature or code before making a commit.
